problem 1 part 1 for first try, I have done the hw two days before, but I tried to make some changes, i found i could only update rmd file but not md file, so i am doing it again, my previous hw3 link is https://github.com/jzs43/p8105_hw3_zj2379/tree/main for reference

## Problem1
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
library(patchwork)
```

```{r}
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

There are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits holding the most items ordered.
