problem 1 part 1 for first try, I have done the hw two days before, but
I tried to make some changes, i found i could only update rmd file but
not md file, so i am doing it again, my previous hw3 link is
<https://github.com/jzs43/p8105_hw3_zj2379/tree/main> for reference

There are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits holding the
most items ordered.

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

![](p8105_hw3_zj2379_2_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |

| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

First, do some data cleaning: format the data to use appropriate
variable names; focus on the “Overall Health” topic include only
responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” organize responses as a factor
taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”

  filter(topic %in% "Overall Health") |>
  mutate(response = fct_relevel(response, "Poor","Fair","Good","Very good","Excellent"))
```

``` r

  summarize(n = n_distinct(location_state)) |>  
  filter(n >= 7)

“Excellent”) among locations in NY State in 2006 and 2010 respectively.
Based on the graphs, the group with “poor” responses has the lowest data
values at both years, good and very good responses have relatively high
data values.

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

Based on the graphs, at the high school equivalent education level, the
number of females exceeds the number of males as age increases. At the
less than high school education level, the number of females first
exceeds the number of males then becomes lower than that of males as age
increases. At the more than high school education level, the number of
females is originally higher than the number of males and then becomes
lower than that of males as age increases.Overall, females and younger
people have relatively higher education level than other age groups.
